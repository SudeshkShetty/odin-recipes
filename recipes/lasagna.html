        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This classic lasagna recipe is made with an easy meat sauce as the base. Layer the sauce with noodles and cheese, then bake until bubbly! This is great for feeding a big family and freezes well, too</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Ground beef</li>
            <li>Onions</li>
            <li>tomato</li>
            <li>cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><p>Start by making the sauce with ground beef, bell peppers, onions, and a combo of tomato sauce, tomato paste, and crushed tomatoes. The three kinds of tomatoes gives the sauce great depth of flavor.</p></li>
            <li><p>Let this simmer while you boil the noodles and get the cheeses ready. We're using ricotta, shredded mozzarella, and parmesan -- like the mix of tomatoes, this 3-cheese blend gives the lasagna great flavor!</p></li>
            <li><p>From there, it's just an assembly job. A cup of meat sauce, a layer of noodles, more sauce, followed by a layer of cheese. Repeat until you have three layers and have used up all the ingredients</p></li>
            <li><p>Bake until bubbly and you're ready to eat!</p></li>
        </ol>
